# DeviceMotion Demo (iOS)

![DeviceMotion Demo](https://github.com/catwalkghost/device-orientation-split/blob/main/assets/img/demo.gif?raw=true)

A demo for using DeviceMotion (Accelerometer) on iOS devices. 

Works in Safari on iOS 13+.

## Notes
This is work in progress.

In order for the main function — `getAccelerometer()` — to work, it needs to be bound to a real `onClick` event.

May need adjustment to work properly in landscape mode.
